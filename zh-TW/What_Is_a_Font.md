title: 字型是什麼？
---

&mdash; 是什麼樣的特質讓字體 (typeface) 與手寫字、書法字、Lettering 美術字、Logo 圖標字不同？

其中最大的不同點，在於字體需要讓字體中的每個字符 (glyph) 與字符之間都能互相搭配得宜。這通常表示字體的設計，以及字體各部份的空間運用，最終演變成一系列謹慎仔細的相互妥協。這些妥協代表我們最好將字型設計視為「創作出字的絕妙組合」，而非「創作出絕妙字的組合」。換句話說，我們必須考慮的是整體、群體，即字與字擺在一起之後看起來如何，並將全體的概念架在怎樣設計出一個絕妙好字之上。

因為重視系統更勝組件的緣故，所以我們要以系統的角度來分析設計程序。橫跨字符間的特徵，是我們想專注的焦點；尤其是設計初期更要以此為目標。

另一件有關字體設計的詭異事在於，我們所要設計的字符形式已大致完全抵定。我們字體設計師的任務，主要不是在開創全新的風格形式，而是根據既有的形式發展出新的版本；這點可能讓新入行的設計師摸不著頭緒。改變可以讓讀者覺得驚奇，但過頭或許又讓讀者敬而遠之，這部份可要好好拿捏。通常設計師很容易陷入單一字符思考的泥淖中；但只要你打從一開始就能理解到，字體中意義最重大的是不斷重複的地方，這樣就能輕鬆避免。字體設計不只是對那些常見型態設計出誰都能辨別的特色差異而已，更要設計最常重複的相同之處。

這些特色不只能幫助你創造出字體獨有的嗓音或氣氛，更能決定該字體適用於或不適用於何種情境，有時候還能協助字型技術脈絡的決斷：若能體認到這幾點，就能受用無窮。

這些概念似乎看來有點令人望而生畏，或是太過抽象以至於無法用這樣的思考方向來想字體設計。然而，如果能趕快適應這些觀念，你就能進入更快速、更有效、更令你心滿意足的字體設計過程。

就讓我們找出字體設計的主要系統特徵吧！

### Construction結構

<img src="images/Construction2.png" alt>

Construction refers to the underlying strokes that form a particular glyph. The kind of construction
you use is arguably one of the most important questions to think about, because the construction
effects so many of the remaining choices, particularly if your design is going to feel somewhat
familiar to readers. In the example above, the white line inside the letters indicate the
approximate construction suggested by the shape of the letters themselves.

結構是指構成某字符的基本筆畫，或許你可以將它想作是字符的骨幹。你所要的結構樣態無疑是該思索的最重要點，因為結構會大幅限縮剩下的後續選擇；若你試圖把字體設計得讓讀者大眾都能熟悉時，更會大大受限。在上面這個例子中，字母內部的白線指示出字母外形所展現的概略架構。

However, the way strokes end (the ‘terminals’) and the ‘serifs’ (see below) are generally not part
of what is meant by ‘construction.’ Construction is the skeleton of the glyph, while rest &ndash;
width, weight, terminals &ndash; are all parts of the flesh.

In the example above, the white line inside the letters indicate the approximate construction
suggested by the shape of the letters themselves.

### Proportion of X-height to Cap-height

<img src="images/Prop.png" alt>

The letters on the left come from [Playfair Display], which has a large x-height relative to its
cap-height. The letters on the right are from [EB Garamond], which has a smaller x-height. In the
sample above, the size of the H has been adjusted so that they match.

### Ascender Height

<img src="images/Ascender%20height.png" alt>

In the example above, the x-heights have been matched in order to illustrate the relative difference
in ascender heights.

Ascenders usually exceed the cap-height by at least a little, especially in text designs. In some
cases, however, they can match or even be lower than the cap-height. Longer ascenders can add
elegance to the look of a typeface. They often go with smaller x-height.

### Descender depth

<img src="images/Descender%20depth.png" alt>

Like ascenders, descenders that are long can feel elegant. 

Taken together, long ascenders and descenders can become difficult to manage. If the typeface will
be used with small line heights, the elongation means letter can collide across rows of text.

## Width

<img src="images/width.png" alt>

The width of a type design will alter not just how it feels but also what it is useful for. The
example on the right is from a text face. The example on the left is from a display design meant to
be eye catching. Letters that are more narrow than the text face example are also possible and can
be used to save space or to fit more text in a smaller space.

### Width regularity versus variability

The letters in the top row of this example show a greater variety of width than do the letters in
the bottom row.

### Weight

<img src="images/Weight.png" alt>

### Slant

### Contrast

Contrast refers to how much variation in stroke width is found within a glyph. Notice in the below
two ‘O’ glyphs that the one on the left has much greater variability in line thickness between the top
and sides of the glyph. Both glyphs have some contrast, but the one on the left has much more than
the one on the right.

<img src="images/Contrast.png" alt>

Type with consistent weight (stroke width) in its letterforms or no visible contrast produces a
sheer distinction from uncontrasted type. Like the choice between serifs or sans-serifs, contrast is
an early choice of type design. It is interesting to note that ‘slab’ serif designs generally use
consistent stroke width in their letters, and that the design of slab serifs is not merely about the
serif, as it sounds! It must be remembered that the rules of perception apply (see [“Trusting your
eyes”]) &ndash; contrast is about how the weight looks but not how it measures out to be.

### Angle of contrast

In the below image, we see that the thin parts of the lower case letter ‘o’ shapes are different. In
the glyph on the left, the thin points lie on a perfectly vertical axis. In the glyph on the right,
the axis is diagonal.

### Weight distribution

If your font uses very little to no contrast, you don’t really need to think of it.  
Most fonts, however, have at least some degree of contrast. In these cases, you have a wide variety
of options to choose from when it comes to how to distribute the weight in your font.

#### Vertical

<img src="images/verical1.png" alt>

Vertical distribution of weight is very common. The 9 and 8 above are a particularly intense
example.

#### Horizontal

<img src="images/horizontal%20weight.png" alt>

Horizontal weight distribution is much less common, but is nonetheless seen in many fonts.

#### Bottom-heavy

<img src="images/2bottomheavy.png" alt>

#### Top-heavy

<img src="images/2topheavy%20metal.png" alt>

#### Irregular

<img src="images/Irregular%20weight.png" alt>

### Stems

<img src="images/8stems.png" alt>

It is easy to assume that your stems will simply be straight and that this isn’t a real concern, but
both the weight and the shape of your stems are things you can and should make deliberate choices
about.

### Joins

<img src="images/7joins.png" alt>

### Bowls

Note that bowls are the stroke part in the below illustrations and not the black inner forms. The
inner strokes are referred as “counters”. While designing type, you will often find yourself
altering your work not because of the shape or width of the stroke but due to the shape and size of
the counter.

<img src="images/2bowls.png" alt>

### Terminals

Terminals are the end forms of the strokes. They are not same as the serifs. They are often
perpendicular to the angle of the stroke at its end, or sheared horizontally or vertically. They may
also reflect the shape of the nib or other mark-making tool that the letter forms evoke.

<img src="images/terminals%20f.png" alt>

### Speed

<img src="images/6speed_1.png" alt>

The ‘n’ on the left seems to be written much faster than the one on the right. Speed is discussed in
more detail in the chapter [on italics].

### Regularity

<img src="images/6regularity.png" alt>

The following characteristics are not present in all type designs, however they are variables that
may be a part of your design. If this is the case, it is worth considering the degree to which they
will play a role as a variable.

### Flourish

<img src="images/5flourish.png" alt>

Notice that in the font on top the flourish is more present in the capital letter and the second one
the flourish is more in the lowercase.

### Serif - To be or not to be

Serifs are one of the most distinct aspects of a typeface, and often the first classification of
type is between serif and sans-serif type.

This choice affects how the end terminals will look like. Serifs can be two sided or one sided. They
can be perpendicular to stroke or have their own direction (like being always horizontal or
vertical). Serifs can be with or without brackets. Any serif design is a mix of all of the above
applied consistently to the type design with some deviations for particular letters, especially the
‘S’, ‘C’ and ‘Z’ (e.g. a type with horizontal serifs for all letters will often have s, c and z to
have vertical serifs).

There is a urban legend asserting that serif types are easier to read than sans-serifs &ndash; it is
[a sole myth](http://asserttrue.blogspot.se/2013/01/the-serif-readability-myth.html), until further
notice.

The form of the serifs are related to the forms of the terminals.

#### 托架 (Brackets)

The corner portions of a serif where it connects to the main stroke are called ‘brackets’. A
particular design may have them giving a soft feel to the serif ([Times New Roman] is an example) or
may choose to not have any bracket. Some designs also use brackets only on one side or with
different proportions on the two sides.

This is a relatively strong parameter that renders feel to the type &ndash; elegance (smooth or
large brackets of [Times New Roman]) or chunky crisp (absent brackets of [Arvo]).

#### 粗襯線體 (Slab-serifs)

Also called mechanistic or Egyptian type, slabs are thick, block-like serifs. Slab serifs don’t use
brackets. Generally speaking, type design with such serifs are seen to have less contrast in their
glyphs &ndash; [Rockwell], [Courier] or [American typewriter] reflect that.

It may be safe to assume that slab serifs have been used to add some ornament or rhythm to an
otherwise no-contrast type design. But this is not an absolute rule.

#### 襯線結尾 (Serif Terminals)

Just like letter terminals, the end shape of the serifs themselves contribute to the feel of the
type &ndash; either soft or chunky. Serif terminals can be soft and rounded ([Courier]) or blunt and
angular ([Rockwell]).
